I want to write a specification for a java program using jdk 21.
The program will solve a maze, allowing escape from the maze from any valid start position to a single exit point.
The solution to the maze will use the optimal exit path with the fewest steps.
Valid movement will be allowed in up,left,down and right directions only, no diagonal moves.
The maze will be randomly generated.
The exit point will be randomly generated.
The maze will be of variable size specified by inputs.
The size will be between 20 - 100 units square.
A player will direct a token from the start point to the exit using keyboard input using 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd' representing up,left,down and right respectively.
A count of the steps used to escape the maze will be maintained and a comparison to the most efficient path to the exit will be revealed on achieving exit.
The program will display the maze on a grid.
Impassable blocks will be displayed as black squares, empty spaces will be white.
